# Sales Performance & Customer Segmentation

This project leverages Python, SQL, and Power BI to perform comprehensive data analysis and machine learning for sales forecasting and customer segmentation.

## Project Overview
In today's retail landscape, shopping malls and Big Marts continuously track item-level sales data to anticipate customer demand and manage inventory effectively. By analyzing and mining this data from the data warehouse, the goal is to uncover anomalies and identify common patterns in customer behavior.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a solution that accurately predicts sales across different Big Mart stores. This model will allow stakeholders to make informed inventory decisions and optimize stock levels, improving overall efficiency.

## Project Components
1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Using SQL to retrieve and preprocess data from the data warehouse.
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Leveraging Python and Power BI for insights on customer segmentation, sales performance, and identifying trends.
3. **Sales Prediction Model:** Developing and training machine learning models to predict store-level sales.
4. **Deployment and Reporting:** Presenting findings and model outputs through interactive Power BI dashboards and structured reports.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database:** SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and other Python libraries

## Results
This project provides actionable insights and accurate sales predictions, supporting data-driven decision-making for Big Martâ€™s inventory and customer management strategies.
